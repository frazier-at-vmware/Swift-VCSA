    /**  CNSFileConfig.vsan-clusters is a list of clusters to be used for provisioning file volumes.   As a prerequisite these clusters must have vSAN and vSAN file services enabled, and must be in the same vCenter as the Supervisor.   Currently this list must have a single entry which is the cluster identifier of the current cluster. This cluster must be a vSAN cluster and must have vSAN File Service enabled.   If a cluster in the list is not a vSAN cluster or does not have vSAN File Service enabled, an InvalidArgument error will be thrown from Clusters.enable, Clusters.update and Clusters.set APIs.   An empty list may be specified to disable file volume support on the Supervisor.  When clients pass a value of this structure as a parameter, the field must contain identifiers for the resource type: ClusterComputeResource. When operations return a value of this structure as a result, the field will contain identifiers for the resource type: ClusterComputeResource. */
