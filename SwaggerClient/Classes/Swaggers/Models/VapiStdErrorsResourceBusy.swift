The documentation for each each operation will describe what, if any, data it provides for each error it reports.    The ArgumentLocations, FileLocations, and TransientIndication structures are intended as possible values for this field. DynamicID may also be useful as a value for this field (although that is not its primary purpose).

Some operations will not set this field when reporting errors. */
